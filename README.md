This is Ralph Biedert's Java Simple Plugin Framework ( JSPF ). 

Mr. Biedert kindly gave AIT permission to fork his project, and to include it in the 
ubicity distribution. This code is an unaltered, unchanged version of Mr. Biedert's code.


JSPF enables any Java / JVM application using it to dynamically load plugins from various sources, 
most commonly from the local file system ( which is the current ubicity technical use case ), but also
from e.g. sockets, http servers etc. etc. 


JSPF is based upon Mr. Biedert's jcores project. Together with jcores, it forms the fundamentals under ubicity.
